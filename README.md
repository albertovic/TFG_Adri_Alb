# TFG_Adri_Alb
Github reposiroty created for sharing codes related to Alberto Vicente and Adri√°n Drag final project (TFG) about underwater communications.

There are two branches apart from the main one. One for each of us. The python files "example.py" are merely there so that the directories appear in github, once there is code there, they can be deleted.
