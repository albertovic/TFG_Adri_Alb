# TFG_Adri_Alb

## Description and indications
Github reposiroty created for sharing codes related to Alberto Vicente and Adri√°n Drag final project (TFG) about underwater communications.

We are developing code that allows us to read values from different sensors connected to an onboard computer inside a ROV (the raspberry pi 4) and send that data to an external computer.

There are two branches apart from the main one. One for each of us. The python files "example.py" are merely there so that the directories appear in github, once there is code there, they can be deleted.

## Understanding the repository
This repository is divided in three main areas. Each of them has their own directory.
- communication_codes: in this directory you can find all the developed code related to communications between the raspberry pi and the computer.
- interface_codes: in this directory you can find all the developed code related to the interface in which data will be shown.
- sensor_codes: in this directory you can find all the developed code related to reading the values of each sensor connected to the raspberry pi.

In later developing steps, a new directory will probably be created so that we can merge the three previous mentioned ones and test them toghether.
